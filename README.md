I built this blog on Aug.22.2022, due to people don't like my previous works.   
I was fine but I closed it not because some disliked my works   
but I was really upset about the reactions of my featured audiences,   
they should be happy to find a sanctuary in my portfolio,  
where people of the same interests were finally gathered here.  
But I saw there were some powerful featured audience were extremely  
against my efforts just because they wanted to be myterious.  
Never imagine how difficult it is for those have no access to this group...  
My originally thoughts are just opening a platform for newbies to know   
how to find a way to this group and hobby, helping those astray know they are never alone.  
Since the pathetic fact is this group is refusing new recuiting,  
not me, I think I should stop my previous platform and restart one.
